        I am, a full-time student of software engineering at the Ada Developers Academy. I joined Ada to begin my coding career months ago, and since then, I've been honing a number of abilities. You can access some of my efforts by visiting <a href="about.html">this</a> page. I had served as a cashier, call agent and the office administrator's assistant before joining Ada. However, I really think that success comes from doing what you love, and I have found Ada to be the perfect place to begin this journey.
        My abilities in coding and web development have improved as a result of working on many Ada projects.
        I am passionately learning new things and am eager to demonstrate my abilities to the world.
